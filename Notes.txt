Manually Find SUID files
"find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null"

In linux you can use chmod to change the permissions of files. Using numeric values You may set
User / Group / Other Permissions such as all permissions ( chmod 777 <file> )
We Get 7's when we add up all the permissions numeric values Read=4, Write=2, Execute=1

Set User ID or SUID is when we give a file permission to run with the users permission that set it.
For example the program "passwd" changes a user accounts passwd. To do so you need root privs. BUT
because the program has the SUID bit set, the program itself runs as "root".
