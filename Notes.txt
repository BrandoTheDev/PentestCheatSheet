Manually Find SUID files
"find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null"

In linux you can use chmod to change the permissions of files. Using numeric values You may set
User / Group / Other Permissions such as all permissions ( chmod 777 <file> )
We Get 7's when we add up all the permissions numeric values Read=4, Write=2, Execute=1

Set User ID or SUID is when we give a file permission to run with the users permission that set it.
For example the program "passwd" changes a user accounts passwd. To do so you need root privs. BUT
because the program has the SUID bit set, the program itself runs as "root".

Writable /etc/passwd
Misconfiguration, adding a backdoor, etc. No matter how you got it, you got it! A way to write to
/etc/passwd. Well lets create an account and setup with some root access after breaking down what
we are looking at. /etc/passwd is a plain text file that has usernames, ID's, home directories, etc

username:passwordhash:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

In this example of an entry we have the obvious username, and every field is seperated by a colon.
password is sometimes shown as a hash and sometimes shown as an "x" - meaning its in /etc/shadow
The next two are user id and group id (0 is root, 1-99 is reserved for system services)
We then have a Info field like comments, names, extra info
Following that we have the users home directory (/root) so we have access to it!
and finally we have the command or shell (normally a shell but doesnt have to be!)

Sudo privs per account
"sudo -l"

Run this every time to see what commands youre able to use as super user per account

Hydra 
"hydra -V -l bob -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -f <ip> -s <port> http-get /protected"

Using this command I was able to brute force into a protected page on a web server. The options are
pretty basic but as a rundown: -V=verbose, -l=Username, -P=Password list, -f=IP, -s=PORT, 
http-get=METHOD, /protected=The web page

When using -l or -p you can change it to -L or -P for lists. There are also a ton of methods: ssh, 
web, ftp, etc.
